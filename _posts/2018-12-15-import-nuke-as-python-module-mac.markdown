In case you've been wondering if it's possible to use nuke's API outside of Nuke, you're not alone.
It's a very common and pratical thing to do.

*If you're on linux or windows.*

If you're on macOS, it's not as straightforward.

Straight from The Foundry support:

<em>Hey Valerio,
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for confirming that you see the same thing using the `/usr/bin/python` version. (note: a segmentation fault while importing nuke.so from python)
<br/>
<br/>
I have been talking with the developers about this, and unfortunately, <strong>setting up the correct libraries for the Nuke module to be imported into an external Python is more complex than just importing the nuke.so file</strong>. This is due to how applications needs to be packed in specific ways to work with Mac, which is why it works correctly on Linux and Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
The simplest way to get a working version would be to use the Python version that ships with Nuke, to run the scripts that you need.
<br/>
<br/>
This Python version can be found here: `/Applications/Nuke11.2v3/Nuke11.2v3.app/Contents/MacOS/python.app`
<br/>
<br/>
It is theoretically possible to set up an external Python version in the same way, however we strongly recommend using the one that ships inside Nuke, as we don't test using external versions of Python.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information helps.
<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards,
<br/>
<br/>

So on linux you shouldn't have any issues by just using the python interpreter that ships with nuke.
But be aware that doing importing nuke in your python session/scripts like this:
`import nuke`

will actually change your `PYTHONPATH`.

Nuke will prepend its own paths at the beginning of your existing `PYTHONPATH` so that it loads the right modules.
For example, let's say that you have `OpenColorIO` installed on your system.
As of now (I guess v10+?) Nuke ships with its own `OpenColorIO`.
If you want to use nuke's OCIO, then you will need to do this:

{% highlight python %}
import nuke
import PyOpenColorIO
{% endhighlight %}

Doing this instead

{% highlight python %}
import PyOpenColorIO
import nuke
{% endhighlight %}

will result in you loading your system level OpenColorIO.

And let me give you a hint: if you do the latter, your session/script will probably crash, unless your `PyOpenColorIO.so` is matching exactly nuke's one (in terms of being the same version and being compiled for the same python version)! üòÅ
