Hi,

Iâ€™m Valerio Viperino, a 28 years old Pipeline TD / creative technologist born near Rome (IT) and currently based in London (UK).

You can find me online as vvzen o yaskebasi.

I wonder through the realms of computational art and computer graphics.

This is mainly a technical blog covering my discoveries while playing & developing software for nuke, houdini, maya.
